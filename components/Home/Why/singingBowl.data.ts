  description:
    "Singing Bowl Village was founded on the vision of preserving and sharing the ancient art of singing bowls. Rooted in the legacy of our founder, the late Mr. Kashiram Lama Tamang, our village represents over 40 years of tradition, craftsmanship, and cultural heritage. Here, every bowl is more than just an instrument—it is a symbol of healing, mindfulness, and spiritual connection. We invite you to experience why Singing Bowl Village stands apart: a place where authenticity meets artistry, and where the timeless sound of singing bowls continues to inspire wellness and transformation.",
