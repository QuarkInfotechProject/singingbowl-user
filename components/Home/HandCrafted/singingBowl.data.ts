  description:
    "Carving bowls are handcrafted by our skilled artisans in Nepal. Each singing bowl takes about 2–3 months to carve, as every detail is made with patience, precision, and traditional techniques. We are proud to be the only sellers in Nepal offering truly authentic hand-carved bowls, especially at a time when most of the market is filled with mass-produced, machine-made imitations. Our work supports local craftsmanship and preserves the traditional art of bowl-making.",
